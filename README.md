# Mobile Robots 2023-2

This project contains all files developed during coursework in Marco Antonio Negrete's Mobile Robots 2023-2 course at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. The aim was to implement a service robot in a ROS simulation  that was capable of the following:
* Recognize voice commands identifying an object and a location.

![command2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cddfdb8-c6ac-4294-82b5-d19a73814f21)
* Determining the centroid of the desired object through images captured on camera.

* Object manipulation.

* Autonomous navigation from starting point to location indicated through voice command.

* Leaving object on the final location.

The simulation is based on UNAM's service robot Justina. More information about the robot can be found [here](https://biorobotics.fi-p.unam.mx/). The original course repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mnegretev/Mobile-Robots-2023-2)
